## Features

- 🎮 **3D Breakout Gameplay**: Watch balls automatically bounce and break bricks in a 3D arena
- 🏗️ **Multiple Brick Layers**: Bricks are arranged in multiple rows and layers with varying health
- ⚡ **Idle Mechanics**: The game plays itself - no input required!
- 📈 **Upgrade System**: Spend points to upgrade ball damage, speed, or add more balls
- 🎨 **Beautiful Visuals**: Colorful bricks, glowing edges, starfield background
- 🖱️ **Interactive Camera**: Rotate and zoom to view the action from any angle
- ⏸️ **Pause/Resume**: Control the game flow
- 🏅 **Prestige / Meta Progression**: Ascend to gain meta bonuses (prestige mechanics) and long-term progression
- 🏆 **Achievements**: Unlock progression and performance milestones
- 💾 **Persistence / Rehydration**: Game progress is persisted to browser storage and rehydrated on load (storage key: `idle-bricks3d:game:v1`).

## Tech Stack

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- pnpm (recommended) or npm / yarn

### Installation

```bash
# Install dependencies (pnpm recommended)
pnpm install
# or: npm install / yarn install

# Start development server
pnpm run dev
# or: npm run dev

# Run tests (see scripts below)
pnpm run test
# or: npm run test

# Build for production
pnpm run build
# or: npm run build
```

### Experimental: SharedArrayBuffer-based physics (POC)

An experimental POC is available that uses SharedArrayBuffer + Atomics to run the per-ball physics simulation in a worker with zero-copy in-place buffers. This is intended to demonstrate potential latency and CPU improvements for high ball counts.

Notes:

- This feature requires cross-origin isolation (COOP/COEP). Use `VITE_ENABLE_COOP=1` when running the dev server.

- Enable the POC via `VITE_ENABLE_SAB=1`.

Example (macOS / Linux):

```bash
VITE_ENABLE_COOP=1 VITE_ENABLE_SAB=1 npm run dev
```

Example (Windows PowerShell):

```powershell
$Env:VITE_ENABLE_COOP = '1'; $Env:VITE_ENABLE_SAB = '1'; npm run dev
```

When enabled, `FrameManager` will attempt to initialize the SAB worker and use it; otherwise the system falls back to the transferable-worker path or single-threaded simulation.

See `docs/SHAREDARRAYBUFFER.md` for more details and caveats about cross-origin isolation and testing.

## Testing

The repository uses Vitest for unit and integration tests. Useful scripts are available in `package.json` (run with `pnpm` / `npm`):

```bash
# Run tests (headless / default)
pnpm run test

# Run tests once (CI-friendly)
pnpm run test:run

# Run tests in watch mode
pnpm run test:watch

# Open the Vitest UI
pnpm run test:ui

# Run tests with coverage
pnpm run test:coverage

# Rapier/physics smoke tests
pnpm run test:rapier-smoke
```

A few notable directories and docs:

- `engine/rapier/` contains the Rapier runtime, helpers and physics integration used by the game.
- `store/persistence/` contains rehydration and storage helpers used to persist game progress.
- `systems/` contains core game systems such as brick behaviors and effect event handling.
- `memory/` (top-level) stores design docs and task tracking used by contributors and agents.

## Contributing & development notes

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for contribution guidelines. This project enforces formatting and linting rules via Prettier and ESLint and uses TypeScript in strict mode — please run the following locally before opening PRs:

```bash
pnpm run format      # Prettier
pnpm run lint        # ESLint
pnpm run typecheck   # TypeScript strict build
pnpm run test:run    # Run all tests once
```

Please follow the repository's coding guidelines and the spec-driven workflow in `.github/instructions` when adding larger changes.

There are also end-to-end tests under `tests/e2e` and a number of Rapier-focused smoke/integration tests under `src/test/rapier`.

## How to Play

1. **Watch**: Balls automatically bounce around and break bricks
2. **Earn Points**: Each brick destroyed awards points based on its layer
3. **Upgrade**: Spend points on upgrades:
   - ⚔️ **Ball Damage**: Increase damage per hit
   - 💨 **Ball Speed**: Make balls move faster
   - 🔮 **New Ball**: Add more balls (up to 20)
4. **Progress**: When all bricks are destroyed, a new wave spawns

5. **Prestige / Meta progression**: When you reach later waves you can choose to 'prestige' (ascend) for permanent meta bonuses that accelerate future runs.

6. **Achievements & Save**: Complete challenges to unlock achievements. Progress is saved and rehydrated on load (localStorage key: `idle-bricks3d:game:v1`).

## Controls

- **Mouse Drag**: Rotate camera
- **Scroll**: Zoom in/out
- **Pause Button**: Pause/resume the game

- **Keyboard**: Space toggles pause/resume; `U` upgrades ball damage (keyboard shortcuts are handled by useKeyboardShortcuts).
- **Mobile / Touch**: Mobile-friendly UI and an upgrade drawer are available (see UI/MobileUpgrades for touch controls).
