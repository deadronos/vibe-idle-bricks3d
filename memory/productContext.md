# Product Context

## Why this project exists
To provide a compact, web-based 3D idle game demonstrating R3F performance and simple progressive mechanics that are approachable for casual players.

## Problems it solves
- Demonstrates performant 3D rendering in a small web app
- Provides an example of a simple, testable upgrade/economy system

## How it should work
- Balls auto-launch and bounce to break bricks, generating score and currency
- Players spend currency on upgrades that persist per session (or via export)
- Visual and UI feedback communicate progression clearly

## User experience goals
- Immediate gratification for new players
- Meaningful upgrade choices
- Consistent framerate and predictable physics
